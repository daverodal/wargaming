                    <p class="ruleComment">
                    During the actual battle, Stalin got fed up with soviet leadership and made General Budyonny a scapegoat.
                    He relieved him after the germans made their encirclement. After that point there was no possibility for the
                    soviets to break out because they could not make corridinated attacks.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            At the end of each phase, the computer checks to see if the soviets loss and the number of surrounded units
                            equals or exceeds the 35 points. If it does, General Budyonny is relieved of command.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the general is relieved, all unsupplied units may not enter a zoc nor may they attack.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once relieved, the effect remains for the entire game. Even if the number of surrounded units lowers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The word dismissed appears on the victory points line once the general is relieved.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
