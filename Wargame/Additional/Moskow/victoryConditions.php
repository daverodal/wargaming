    <h2>Setting Up</h2>

    <ul>
       <li> The Soviet player sets up their units first. When they are done placing their units, they should hit "next phase"</li>
        <li>The German player places their units next. They should hit "next phase when done."</li>
        <li>At this point it's the german movement phase. The normal sequence of play starts from here.</li>
        <li>Note: the german player gets no replacement phase on turn one because all their units are at full strength.</li>
    </ul>
