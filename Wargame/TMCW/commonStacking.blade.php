<span class="big">Stacking</span>
<ol>
    <li>Units may not be stacking at end of their movement. They pass through other friendly units but must end
        their phase unstacked.</li>
    <li>If units are forced to retreat during combat, they must end the retreat in an empty hex. They may
    pass through hexes occupied by friendly units. This may cause them to retreat farther than the crt mandates.</li>
