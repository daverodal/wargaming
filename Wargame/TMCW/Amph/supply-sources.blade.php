<p>The Loyalist may trace their supply to any edge of the map.</p>
<p>The Rebel player must trace it's supply line to a supply hex.
    Supply hexs are created automatically, in every hex the rebel player initally deploys a unit. </p>
<p>If a Loyalist players unit enters a rebel supply hex it is destroyed and supply may no longer be traced to that hex.
    Reinforcements may not arrive there either.</p>
