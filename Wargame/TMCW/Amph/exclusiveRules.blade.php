        <ol>
            <li> The Loyalist players units are already setup.</li>
            <li>The Rebel Player places their units on the first turn. They will appear in a box labeled Deploy/Staging.
                The placement of the non airborne unit will determine where the beachheads appear. Beachhead hexes are
                where supply and non airborne reinforcements appear.</li>
            <li>
                Airborne units once places will create an air landing zone. Air landing zones are where airborne supply and
                reinforcements appear.
            </li>
            <li>If all air landing zones are occupied and destroyed by the loyalist player,
                future airborne units, if any, will arrive at a beach landing zone, one turn later than normal
