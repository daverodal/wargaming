        <ol>
            <li>A single unit may only participate in single attack in the friendly attack phase.</li>
            <li>All combat is between adjacent units.</li>
            <li>Units may attack more than one unit. See multi unit combat below.</li>
            <li>More than one attacker may participate in an attack.</li>
            <li>Combat odds are determined by adding the attack strength of all attacking units and
                dividing it by the
                defense strength of all defending units. All fractions are rounded down, favoring the defender.
                <p class="ruleComment">If if the total attack strength was 26 against a defense of 9 the odds would be 2-1</p>
            </li>
            <li>Attacks may always be made at lower than odds than those gained by calculation. See Pinning combat odds below.
          </li>
            <li>All attacks are voluntary. You may attack as many or as few units that are adjacent to
                your units.

                    <li>Next, click on an adjacent attacker you with to attack with. You will see the odds calculated in a little white circle over the defender.The attacker

                    You will also note a yellow column will appear the reflects the odds of the attack. You may also hit "details" now to see a break down of the attack.</li>
                    <li>If you click on more attackers, the odds will recalculate each time. If you want to remove an attacker click on it again.</li>

                to resolve combat.
                <p class="ruleComment">People often lower the odds to avoid exchanges, often when a high
