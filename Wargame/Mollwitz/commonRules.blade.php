            <h2>Common Rules</h2>

            <p> These are the common rules for the Fredrick the Great Game System. These rules also will include the
                exclusive
                rules,
                for this particular game, &ldquo;<?= $name ?>&rdquo;. Exclusive rule also available for "at a glance"
                difference
                between this and other games.</p>

            <p>Exclusive rules contained in here will be in green</p>

            <h3> Quick Start Guide #3</h3>
            <p>
                The assumption is made that the reader is extensively familiar with Hex and counter games. Boiler Plate
                is omitted.
                E.G. I tell you what a ZOC does but not what it is. All number rounding is down for all calculations. No
                stacking.
                No Supply.

                                    in the crt you wish to lower the odds to. A purple column on the lowered odds should

                                    will appear over 1:1. During combat resolution the lowered odds will be used
