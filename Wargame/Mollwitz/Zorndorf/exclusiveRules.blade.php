        During the Prussian Deploy Phase, there is a 50/50 chance they will be allowed to deploy in the P1
        Hexes, or the P2 hexes.
        This will not be obvious until the Prussian player tries to deploy their first unit.
        A surprise to both players.
        <p class="ruleComment">This reflects the fact that the prussians were performing a flanking
            maneuver and there was a chance that russians would notice before the battle started.</p>
