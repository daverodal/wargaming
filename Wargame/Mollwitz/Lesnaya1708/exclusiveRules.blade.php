            <p>Wagons are supply wagons, and are highly valueable. Wagons have no attack strength, defend with a
                strength of 2 and may stack with one other non wagon unit. If
                a hex containing a wagon and another unit is attacked, the combined strength of the units are used to
                defend. If the result is a DR, the wagon is destroyed. Wagons look like this.
                Wagons are worth 5 victory points if destroyed. See victory below.</p>
