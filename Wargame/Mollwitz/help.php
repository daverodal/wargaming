<h3> Quick Start Guide #3</h3>
<header>
    The assumption is made that the reader is extensively familiar with Hex and counter games. Boiler Plate is omitted.
    E.G. I tell you what a ZOC does but not what it is. All number rounding is down for all calculations. No stacking.
    No Supply.
</header>
<h2>Turn Order</h2>
<ol>


    <li>Prussian Movement Phase</li>

    <li> Prussian Attack Phase</li>

    <li>Russian Movement Phase (No Russian unit may expend more than 2 MP on turn 1 only)</li>

    <li>Russian Attack phase</li>

    <li>Turn End</li>
</ol>
<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>The Second Number on the counter is Movement Points <abbr title="Movement Points">(MP)</abbr>.</p>

<p>Units expend different amounts of <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> for different terrains</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear and Town, 1 <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> to enter.</li>

    <li>Woods. Infantry 2 <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> to enter. Cavalry Artillery 3 <abbr
            title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> to enter
    </li>

    <li>Creek, All units expend 1 extra movement point to cross a Creek hex side, except when using road movement and
        crossing on a bridge.
    </li>

    <li>Road Movement. Units pay only &frac12; movement point when moving along contiguous road hexes regardless of
        other terrain in the hex.. Units are not obliged to use the road movement bonus however if they do they may not
        attack in that turn.
    </li>

    <li>Zones of Control. When a unit enters a Hostile <abbr title="Zone Of Control">ZOC</abbr> it must stop and move no
        further that turn. When a unit exits a hostile zone of control it must stop and move no further that turn. A
        unit may move from hostile ZOC to hostile ZOC but only at the rate of one hex a turn.
    </li>
    <li>Regardless of movement points required, a unit may always move at least one hex per turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combat (Attacks)</h2>

<p>The first number on a unit is it's combat factor.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A single unit may only participate in single attack in the friendly attack phase.</li>
    <li>Attacks may always be made at lower than odds than those gained by calculation.</li>
    <li>All attacks are voluntary. Except that all hostile units adjacent to an attacking unit must them selves be
        attacked even if only by artillery bombardment.
    </li>
    <li>All combat is between adjacent units except that artillery may attack units up to two hexes away (Bombardment).
        Including into but not over town, hill or woods. Artillery units may not participate in bombardment attacks if they adjacent to an enemy unit,
        they must attack an adjacent unit if they attack at all.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Multi Hex Multi Unit Combat</h4>

<p>A single unit may attack any or all hostile units that it is adjacent to so long as the odds are not worse than 1-4.
    All attacks against a group of contiguous defenders may be grouped together and resolved as a single attack so long
    as those defenders occupy a single terrain type.</p>

<p>
<h4>Retreats</h4> Whenever obligated by combat result, or choosing to retreat a unit before combat, the owning player
retreats his units obeying the following requirements. Units may not retreat off board, or into enemy zones of control,
the minimum number friendly of friendly units may be displaced 1 hex each to allow a unit to retreat. Units that cannot
retreat are eliminated.
</p>
<h4>Retreat Before Combat</h4> Any cavalry unit that is attacked solely by infantry may instead of suffering the attack
be retreated by the owning player 1 hex after the attack is announced and before the die is rolled.

<h4>Advance after combat</h4> If a defending hex is left vacant any adjacent attacker that participated in the attack my
be moved into that hex. This must be done before the next attack is resolved. Artillery units may NOT advance after combat.

        <h4>Terrain Effects on Combat</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Russian Infantry units are +1 to their combat factor when Attacking into or Defending in woods or
                towns, unless they are attacking across a creek or bridge.
            </li>

            <li>Prussian Infantry units are +1 to their combat factor when Attacking into or Defending in clear,  unless they are attacking across a creek or bridge.</li>

            <li>All Cavalry units combat factors are divided by 2 when attacking into hexes or across hex sides other
                than clear.
            </li>

            <li>All Infantry and artillery have their combat factors doubled when defending in a town</li>

            <li>All Units have their combat factors doubled when defending on a hill</li>

            <li>All Units except artillery have their combat factors divided by 2 when attacking across creek or bridge
                hex sides.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Combined Arms Bonus</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Any attack starting at 1-1 odds or better against clear terrain hex, that includes attacking units from
                two different branches of service is receives 1 favorable column shift.
            </li>
            <li>Any attack against a clear terrain hex that includes attacking units from all three different branches
                of service receives 2 favorable column shifts.
            </li>
            <li>Any attack against a non clear terrain hex that includes both Infantry and artillery enjoys a 1 column
                favorable odds shift.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<h4>Historical set up (The Prussians Probably Lose)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The Russian player sets up first.</li>
    <li>He must deploy an artillery unit on the hill north of Norkitten Forrest</li>

    <li>He must deploy a cavalry unit on each hex marked RC north of Norkitten Forrest and south of the Alm creek.</li>

    <li>The balance of his units may be deployed on any hex marked "R" and or east of the line of Hexes marked "R"
        running from the Alm Creek north to the board edge.
    </li>

    <li>The Prussian Player sets up after the Russian player is finished setting up</li>

    <li>He must place a Prussian Cavalry unit on each hex marked "PC" North of Gross Jagersdorf and South of the Alm
        Creek.
    </li>

    <li>The Balance of his units must be deployed on Hexes marked "P" and or within the line of hexes marked "P" around
        Gross Jagersdorf.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Attempt at balance Set up Variant</h4>

<p>The Russian player removes from his OOB 1 artillery unit and 4 other units of his choice. If any are cavalry he is
    not obligated to cover all "RC" hexes though he must cover as many as he can. He must always place an artillery unit
    on the hill North of the Norkitten woods.</p>

<h2>Victory Conditions</h2>
<h4>The Game ends instantly at the end of any Turn when one or more of the following conditions applies. Mutual
    victories are a Draw</h4>
<ol>
    <li> At the end of any turn that the Prussian player has lost an accumulated total of units with unmodified combat
        strengths of 20 Russian victory.
    </li>
    <li>At the end of any turn that the Russian player has lost an accumulated total of units with unmodified combat
        strengths of 25 Prussian victory.
    </li>

    <li>There are no Russian units between the Alm and Litten creeks and there is a Prussian Unit on either hex of the
        East most Bridge of Alm creek. Prussian Victory
    </li>

    <li>There are no Russian units in the Norkitten forest or it's clearing. Prussian Victory.</li>


    <li>Any Prussian turn concludes with no Prussian units within 5 hexes of Gross Jagersdorf (inclusive) and north of
        the Alt Creek. Russian Victory
    </li>

    <li>Turn 12 concludes with none of the above conditions met. Draw</li>
</ol>

<h2>Alternate Victory Conditions</h2>
<h4>Use with or without the reduced Russian <abbr title="Order Of Battle">OOB</abbr></h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        The Prussian player has lost an accumulated total of units with unmodified combat strengths of 25 Russian
        Victory.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Russian player has lost an accumulated total of units with unmodified combat strengths of 25 Prussian
        Victory.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are more Prussian units than Russian units between the Alm and Litten creeks and there is a Prussian Unit
        on either hex of the East most Bridge of Alm creek. Prussian Victory
    </li>
    <li>
        That player with the most units on Norkitten woods hexes (including the clearing and hill hex) at the end of
        turn 10 wins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any Prussian turn concludes with no Prussian units within 5 hexes of Gross Jagersdorf (inclusive) and north of
        the Alt Creek. Russian Victory
    </li>
    <li>
        Turn 10 concludes with none of the above conditions met. Draw
    </li>
