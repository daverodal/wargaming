<h3> Quick Start Guide #3</h3>
<header>
    The assumption is made that the reader is extensively familiar with Hex and counter games. Boiler Plate is omitted.
    E.G. I tell you what a ZOC does but not what it is. All number rounding is down for all calculations. No stacking.
    No Supply.
</header>
<h2>Turn Order</h2>
<p>The game is divided in to phases as you complete each phase click 'Next Phase' on the top bar to proceed to the next phase. </p>
<ol>


    <li><h3>On the first turn of the game you will be instructed to deploy units.</h3>
        <p>The units you need to deploy will appear in the top bar. When you click on a unit a ghost of it will appear on the map. Click on one of the ghosts and the unit will be placed on the map. (you are not required to deploy all of your units you can decline to place some of the units to balance the game.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Prussian Movement Phase</h3>
    <p>
        Click on one of your units. Ghosts will appear where it can legally move. Click on a ghost to move the unit to that location. If it has remaining movement that will be indicated by Ghosts. If you are satisfied with your move click on it again and the ghosts will disappear.
        Road Movement: Your units may move faster along roads but you must put them into road Move mode to get the benefit. Click on a unit before you move it. Now press <M> you will now see that your unit can move further along roads. This is also the Only way to use bridges. Units that road move may not attack in the following combat phase.
    </p></li>

    <li> <h3>Prussian Attack Phase</h3>
    <p>
        A] Attack planning Phase: When you start your attack phase all of your units that are eligible to attack will be highlighted. Click on a hostile unit you want to attack then click on one of your adjacent highlighted units. A red arrow will appear indicating that your unit is now committed to an attack. At the same time the combat results table will appear showing you the possible results. You can add more units to the attack by clicking on them. You can also have your unit attack more than one hostile unit by pressing <Shift> and clicking on your unit again then clicking on the new target. You may not make attacks at less than 1-4 odds.
            Artillery: Designate artillery attacks the same way but you may attack a hostile unit up to 3 hexes away (or 2 if reduced visibility) if your artillery is not adjacent to a hostile unit. And you have a clear line of sight.

            B] Combat Resolution Phase: Click on a hostile unit you targeted in attack planning. The combat result will appear. If the hostile unit needs to be retreated click on it and move it one space. See Retreats bellow. If your unit is allowed to advance click on it and move it in to the hex vacated by the hostile unit, or if you do not want to advance click on your unit again. Move on to the next combat. Once complete click on next phase to move to your opponentâ€™s turn
    </p></li>

    <li><h3>Russian Movement Phase (No Russian unit may expend more than 2 MP on turn 1 only)</h3><p>see Prussian Movement above.</p></li>

    <li><h3>Russian Attack phase</h3><p>see Prussian Attack above.</p></li>

    <li><h3>Turn End</h3></li>
</ol>
<h2>Stacking</h2>
<p>No more than one unit may occupy the same hex at any given, however friendly units may move through each other.</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>The Second Number on the counter is Movement Points <abbr title="Movement Points">(MP)</abbr>.</p>

<p>Units expend different amounts of <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> for different terrains</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear and Town, 1 <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> to enter.</li>

    <li>Woods. Infantry 2 <abbr title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> to enter. Cavalry Artillery 3 <abbr
            title="Movement Points">MP</abbr> to enter
    </li>

    <li>Creek, All units expend 1 extra movement point to cross a Creek hex side, except when using road movement and
        crossing on a bridge.
    </li>

    <li>Road Movement. Units pay only &frac12; movement point when moving along contiguous road hexes regardless of
        other terrain in the hex.. Units are not obliged to use the road movement bonus however if they do they may not
        attack in that turn.
    </li>

    <li>Zones of Control. When a unit enters a Hostile <abbr title="Zone Of Control">ZOC</abbr> it must stop and move no
        further that turn. When a unit exits a hostile zone of control it must stop and move no further that turn. A
        unit may move from hostile ZOC to hostile ZOC but only at the rate of one hex a turn.
    </li>
    <li>Regardless of movement points required, a unit may always move at least one hex per turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combat (Attacks)</h2>

<p>The first number on a unit is it's combat factor.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A single unit may only participate in single attack in the friendly attack phase.</li>
    <li>Attacks may always be made at lower than odds than those gained by calculation.</li>
    <li>All attacks are voluntary. Except that all hostile units adjacent to an attacking unit must them selves be
        attacked even if only by artillery bombardment.
    </li>
    <li>All combat is between adjacent units except that artillery may attack units up to two hexes away (Bombardment).
        Including into but not over town, hill or woods. Artillery units may not participate in bombardment attacks if they adjacent to an enemy unit,
        they must attack an adjacent unit if they attack at all.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Multi Hex Multi Unit Combat</h4>

<p>A single unit may attack any or all hostile units that it is adjacent to so long as the odds are not worse than 1-4.
    All attacks against a group of contiguous defenders may be grouped together and resolved as a single attack so long
    as all attackers are within range of all defenders. The terrain applied to the combat situation is the most favorable to the defender.</p>
<p>In order to attack more than one unit, click on a defender (it should get a yellow border),
    then click on the second defender you with to attack while holding down the shift key (you should see two units with a yellow border).
    you may click on eligible attackers and arrows should appear point at both defenders.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Retreats</h4> Whenever obligated by combat result,  the attacking player
retreats the units (attacking or defending) obeying the following requirements. Units may not retreat off board, or into enemy zones of control,
If a unit cannot find an empty it may retreat over friendly hexes until it finds an empty hex. Units that cannot
retreat are eliminated.
</p>
<h4>Retreat Before Combat</h4> To simmulate retreat before combat, when only non cavalry units are attacking only cavalry units
the cavalry can do a "retreat before combat" this is reflected in the 'cavalry combat results table', which has all DR's where EX's or DE's would be.
You may click on the crt where it says "see cavalry table" or "see normal table" to toggle between them.

<h4>Advance after combat</h4> If a defending hex is left vacant any adjacent attacker that participated in the attack my
be moved into that hex. This must be done before the next attack is resolved. Artillery units may NOT advance after combat.

        <h4>Terrain Effects on Combat</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Russian Infantry units are +1 to their combat factor when Attacking into or Defending in woods or
                towns, unless they are attacking across a creek or bridge.
            </li>

            <li>Prussian Infantry units are +1 to their combat factor when Attacking into or Defending in clear,  unless they are attacking across a creek or bridge.</li>

            <li>All Cavalry units combat factors are divided by 2 when attacking into hexes or across hex sides other
                than clear.

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Combined Arms Bonus</h4>

            </li>
            <li>Any attack against a clear terrain hex that includes attacking units from all three different branches
                of service receives 2 favorable column shifts.

<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<h4>Historical set up (The Prussians Probably Lose)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The Russian player sets up first.</li>
    <li>He must deploy an artillery unit on the hill north of Norkitten Forrest</li>

    <li>He must deploy a cavalry unit on each hex marked RC north of Norkitten Forrest and south of the Alm creek.</li>

    <li>The balance of his units may be deployed on any hex marked "R" and or east of the line of Hexes marked "R"
        running from the Alm Creek north to the board edge.
    </li>

    <li>The Prussian Player sets up after the Russian player is finished setting up</li>

    <li>He must place a Prussian Cavalry unit on each hex marked "PC" North of Gross Jagersdorf and South of the Alm
        Creek.
    </li>

    <li>The Balance of his units must be deployed on Hexes marked "P" and or within the line of hexes marked "P" around
        Gross Jagersdorf.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Attempt at balance Set up Variant</h4>

<p>The Russian player removes from his OOB 1 artillery unit and 4 other units of his choice. If any are cavalry he is
    not obligated to cover all "RC" hexes though he must cover as many as he can. He must always place an artillery unit
    on the hill North of the Norkitten woods.</p>

<h2>Victory Conditions</h2>
<h4>The Game ends instantly at the end of any Turn when one or more of the following conditions applies. Mutual
    victories are a Draw</h4>
<ol>
    <li> At the end of any turn that the Prussian player has lost an accumulated total of units with unmodified combat
        strengths of 20 Russian victory.
    </li>
    <li>At the end of any turn that the Russian player has lost an accumulated total of units with unmodified combat
        strengths of 25 Prussian victory.
    </li>

    <li>Any Prussian turn concludes with no Prussian units within 5 hexes of Gross Jagersdorf (inclusive) and north of
        the Alt Creek. Russian Victory
    </li>

    <li>Turn 12 concludes with none of the above conditions met. Draw</li>
</ol>

<h2>Alternate Victory Conditions</h2>
<h4>Use with or without the reduced Russian <abbr title="Order Of Battle">OOB</abbr></h4>
